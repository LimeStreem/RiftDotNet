	/// This class manages all those tedious details of the Rift SDK.
	/// Only one instance of a manager should be needed and instantiated when the program starts
	/// (or when VR mode is to be entered).
	/// 
	/// The manager keeps track all all HMDs attached to the system and allows the user to retrieve
	/// objects representing those, in addition to be notified of device changes.
	/// 
	/// The manager supports multiple devices, and even keeps track of which object instances correspond
	/// to which device. Only one IHMD instance per physical device is ever created, meaning you, the user,
	/// can simply use that one instance, without worrying about device attachement/detachement.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// Currently, a physical device is identified by manufacturer, product name and version, as reported by
	/// the SDK.
